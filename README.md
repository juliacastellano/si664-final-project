# Hospital Payment and Value of Care

## Purpose
I am interested in creating a database and Django app for a dataset related to healthcare.
For the Django application, I believe it would be helpful to have a list of
states to choose from. Once a state is chosen, it will show all of the hospitals
within that state that have data. The user can then choose a hospital, where they
will then see a list of the different ailments. Once the user chooses a specific
ailment to look at, they will see the payment and value of care information for
that particular illness at that specific hospital. I think this is the best way
to do it because the hospitals have data for different ailments. I also think it
would be a good idea to have a hospital information tab, where the user can choose
a specific hospital and it will display the address and phone information for the
hospital.

## Data set
I chose the â€œHospital Payment and Value of Care dataset
(https://www.kaggle.com/cms/paymentandvalue2017).
This dataset includes information on payment and value of care for a number of
hospitals in the United States. The dataset includes data for a variety of common
ailments, such as heart attack and pneumonia.
